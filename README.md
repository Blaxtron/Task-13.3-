I learned a lot from this chapter, I learned the different types of artificial neurons, the Perceptron, and the Sigmoid.
--
I also learned how the sigmoid's superior to the perceptron in that it may output numbers between 0 and 1 instead of it just outputting binaries.
--
i learned about the gradient descent, however i didn't understand some of it due to my limited knowledge in maths considering i just finished the preparatory year.
--
I also learned how to implement all that I learned in code, albeit not all of it due to the time constraint.
--
I think it was a very enlighting experience overall, reading a book is way different than watching a youtube series in my view.
--
I used Pytorch and it wasn't a hassle to deal with.

# Thanks for reading ^-^
